This extension addresses the challenges of dealing with large documents or multiple sources of content on the web, particularly:

## **APIs Used**

### 1. **Google Gemini API (Generative AI)**
   - **Google Gemini** (formerly known as **Google AI**) is used for all the **AI-powered functionalities** such as translation, summarization, and rewriting. The extension utilizes this API to process and manipulate document content and to generate new summaries or rewritten versions.

### 2. **Google File Manager API**
   - **Google AI File Manager** is used to upload documents for processing, such as translating or summarizing them using the Gemini API. It helps manage and process files before sending them to the Google Gemini model for AI tasks.

     - Uploading documents (PDF, DOCX) to the server.
     - Handling file processing between the user's browser and the backend.

### 3. **Google Chrome Extension API**
